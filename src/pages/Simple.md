This is a simple demonstration of how to connect all the standard HTML form elements to `redux-form`.

For the most part, it is a matter of simply giving the provided `field` value as props with the spread operator: 
`{...field}`.

This form does no validation. To learn about how to do client-side validation, see the 
[Synchronous Validation](#/synchronous-validation) example.
